### Datasets

We plan to use U.S. census data on the languages spoken within the U.S. We can already access some datasets that could be useful. We have access to tables of detailed languages spoken at home from the 2009-2013 census based on [state](www2.census.gov/library/data/tables/2008/demo/language-use/2009-2013-acs-lang-tables-state.xls?#),[ county](www2.census.gov/library/data/tables/2008/demo/language-use/2009-2013-acs-lang-tables-county.xls?#
), and [core-based statistical areas](www2.census.gov/library/data/tables/2008/demo/language-use/2009-2013-acs-lang-tables-cbsa.xls?#). We are still looking for a way to use the actual census data answers to the questions: "Does this person speak a language other than English at home?, What is this language?, How well does this person speak English (very well, well, not well, not at all)?" ([Source](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/language-use/about/historical.htm)). On the census website we have only been able to find data on number of people who speak these languages based upon these questions, instead of the raw data itself. In addition, we also have access to the data on the language spoken at home based on the 1990 census. It is generally illegal to use census data for any purpose other than statistical research. As students. we assume that we have open access to the public data that the general public has access to for this purpose. For ethical reasons, we should not stereotype people based on regions or stereotype regions based upon the people who live there (i.e. racial profiling).

### Questions

Recently we have heard [news cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9XcdE91ScM) often talking about the demographic changes in American communities, and the unease with some citizens about the major shift in culture within those communities.By exploring this data, we would like to answer questions the changes in demographics concerning immigrant populations over time and specific regions. For instance, the Census Bureau has done a [study](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2017/08/changing-nation-demographic-trends.html) showing that the newest generation is more racially and ethnically diverse. We want to see if this is occurring in concentrated pockets or if it is more spread out. Another question we may want to explore is how the most diverse populations have changed over time and possibly try to deduce why. We chose to focus on language instead of race because speaking a different language comes with inherit cultural differences, which affect the types of businesses in the region(i.e. ethnic restaurants) and the interactions that people have(i.e. cultural festivals and multilingual classrooms).
