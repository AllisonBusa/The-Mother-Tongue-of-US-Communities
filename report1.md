# What is the Mother Tongue of U.S. Communities?

By watching the news, a person can assume that diversity is increasingly rapidly in the United States. While the Census has praised the U.S. for becoming overall more racial and ethnically diverse, FOX newscaster Tucker Carlson has claimed that the rise of immigrants in the U.S. is not happening in "politicians' neighborhoods" and that the increase of racial and cultural groups from non-western countries is changing the culture in American towns to an unprecedented and unmanageable degree. (See Project Proposal)

We wanted to take these two clashing statements and put them both to the test. Has cultural diversity, measured through linguistic diversity, increased significantly in the past few years? How is cultural diversity, through linguistic diversity, spread out throughout the U.S.? Are regions with high ratios of non-English speakers actually linguistically diverse or homogeneously consisting of a non-English speaking community?

In the U.S., citizens are required to answer the Census, including the questions: "Does this person speak a language other than English at home?" and "What is this language?" The Census then conglomerates this data into a dataset, which contains over 380 languages and the corresponding number of respondents which speak them. We looked at three of these datasets: a 2000 dataset, a dataset of accumulated data from 2006 to 2008 and a dataset of accumulated data from 2009 to 2013. From here, we will refer to speakers of non-English languages at home as SONELAHs  and speakers of only English as SOE.

Armed with this Census data about languages spoken at home, we decided to investigate Tucker Carlson's claim...

We started by creating a table that shows the temporal and spatial changes of linguistic diversity at the state level.

California consistently has the highest percent of SONELAHs. We attributed this to a few different reasons. California belonging to Mexico means that there possibly is a higher percentage of Spanish speakers. California being a coastal state that contains many large cities means that it has a lot of places that are practical for an immigrant to come to when immigrating. Similarly, for New Mexico and Texas, which consistently are ranked second and third, we assume that there is Latin heritage is prevalent, due to the regions being once part of Mexico.

Also note that New York, which contains New York City - a place that is synonymous with immigration- is ranked fourth in 2000 and 2006-2008. In the 2009 to 2013 period, it loses its fourth place spot to New Jersey, which has been increasing in rank for every period.

Looking at the state level, however, does not tell us a lot about communities. Looking at the county level, we can infer what a community might look like.

Only our 2000 and 2009-2013 data sets have data on counties. Therefore, we used these two datasets to plot change in the PMF of SONELAHs per county in California.

Los Angeles has the largest population, and thus, the largest number of SONELAHs. However, Los Angeles is an major city in a geographically large state. We see that the distribution of percentage of SONELAHs is more widely spread with so many different places to sample. For example, Los Angeles has the most SONELAHs, at more than 50 % of the population, while Placer County has only about 10 % of its population consist of SONELAHs. That is like every other person being a SONELAH to every tenth person being a SONELAH.

We want to also know if these people represent one culture, or many cultures. One way of looking at this is to abstract a few languages into groups, and see what percentage of the total population falls into these groups. The groups which we picked were :'Spanish and Creole', 'German, Italian and Scandinavian', 'Asian and Pacific Island Languages' and 'Native North American Languages'. Although this list is by no means inclusive, it is simple and the groups are fairly different from one another.
We graphed the counties of California again, this time showing the percentages of SONELAHs in these language groups.

We see a large population of Spanish and Asian language SONELAHs. This is a result that we do not find surprising, considering the history of Asian immigration to California and the Latin heritage of a state that was formerly part of Mexico.

San Francisco, which has a high percentage of Asian and Pacific Island languages, has the second highest population of Chinese-Americans in the U.S., and yet the percentage of Asian and Pacific Island language SONELAHs in the county is only around 15 %. This means that the most culturally concentrated, only about every seventh person is an Asian and Pacific Island language SONELAH.

Looking at the linguistic make-up of the state with the highest percentage of non-English speakers, we wondered if a state with a low percentage of non-English speakers would look similar or different.

We graphed the PMF of the four language groups we have chosen.
