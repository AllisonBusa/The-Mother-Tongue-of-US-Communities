### What is the Mother Tongue if U.S. Communities?

Allison Busa and Jordan Crawford-O'Banner

The racial and cultural demographics of the United States have been changing with each generation. The current generation has been heralded as the most diverse in the history of the country. However, some Americans do not feel very positively about this change, and some even feel that the change is happening too rapidly. We decided to use the data from the U.S. Census to put these claims to the test. Through language data, we ask "Is cultural diversity changing over time?" and "How is it spread out?" We use PMFs to analyze the number of people who speak a language other than English at home(SONELAHs). While linguistic diversity is spread out at the state level, at the county level, counties in the same state follow a similar pattern.
